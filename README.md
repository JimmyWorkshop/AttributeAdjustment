# Attribute Adjustment

## Installation

Go to [releases](https://github.com/JimmyWorkshop/AttributeAdjustment/releases), download the .zip file for the version you want to use.
It's unlikely for updates to break the mod, but dependencies on Harmony and MCM may need updating.

 - When you have downloaded the .zip, use your zip extractor program (I use 7zip here) to extract the files.
 - On Windows Explorer (or your chosen explorer for your file system) navigate to your Bannerlord game folder.
 - Go to the modules folder.
 - Drag your AttributeAdjustment folder into the modules folder.

Your modules folder should look similar to this:

This mod should now show when you start the game.
